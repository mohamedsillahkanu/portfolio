# 📖 **Chapter 1: Introduction to Functions**  

## **1.1 What is a Function?**  
A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. In mathematics, functions take an input, perform some operations, and return an output. In programming, functions work the same way—they help structure code, improve reusability, and make programs easier to read.  

### **Mathematical Example**  
Let's consider a simple mathematical function:  
\[
f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5
\]
If we input \( x = 2 \), we get:  
\[
f(2) = 2^2 + 3(2) + 5 = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15
\]

### **Programming Example**  
We can write this function in Python:  
```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 3*x + 5

print(f(2))  # Output: 15
```
✅ **Explanation:**  
- `def f(x):` defines a function named `f` that takes one parameter `x`.  
- `return x**2 + 3*x + 5` computes the mathematical function and returns the result.  
- `print(f(2))` calls the function with `x = 2`, and it prints `15`.

## **1.2 Why Are Functions Important?**  
### 🚀 **1.2.1 Code Reusability**  
Imagine you're calculating the area of different circles. Instead of writing the formula multiple times, you can use a function.  

```python
def area_of_circle(radius):
    return 3.1416 * radius**2

print(area_of_circle(5))  # Output: 78.54
print(area_of_circle(10)) # Output: 314.16
```
✅ **Explanation:**  
- The function `area_of_circle(radius)` calculates the area using the formula **πr²**.  
- We can call it with different values (`radius = 5, 10, etc.`) without rewriting the formula every time.

### 🔄 **1.2.2 Avoiding Repetition**  
If you’re writing a program that converts temperatures, functions prevent repetition:  
```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0))   # Output: 32.0
print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)) # Output: 212.0
```
✅ **Explanation:**  
- Instead of manually converting temperatures, we use a function to do the work.  
- It takes **celsius** as input and returns the Fahrenheit equivalent.

### 💡 **1.2.3 Breaking Down Complex Problems**  
Think about a **shopping cart** system in an online store. Instead of writing one large block of code, we can break it down into small functions:  

```python
def calculate_price(price, quantity):
    return price * quantity

def apply_discount(total, discount):
    return total - (total * discount / 100)

# Using the functions
total_price = calculate_price(20, 3)  # 20 * 3 = 60
final_price = apply_discount(total_price, 10)  # 60 - 10% = 54
print(final_price)  # Output: 54.0
```
✅ **Explanation:**  
- We create **two separate functions**—one to calculate price and another to apply discounts.  
- This makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.

## **1.3 How Functions Originated**  
### 🔢 **1.3.1 Functions in Mathematics**  
Functions date back to ancient Greece, where mathematicians like Euclid and Pythagoras studied relationships between numbers.  

- **Leonhard Euler (1748)** formalized the function notation **f(x)**, which we still use today.  
- In **calculus**, functions describe rates of change and help in physics, economics, and engineering.  

### 💻 **1.3.2 Functions in Programming**  
The concept of functions in programming was inspired by mathematics. Early languages like **Fortran (1957)** introduced subroutines, which evolved into functions in modern languages like **Python, Java, and JavaScript**.

## **1.4 Real-World Examples of Functions**  
### 🌡 **1.4.1 Weather Prediction**  
Weather models use functions to compute **temperature trends** based on past data:  

```python
def predict_temperature(current_temp, rate_of_change):
    return current_temp + rate_of_change

print(predict_temperature(25, 2))  # Output: 27
```

### 📊 **1.4.2 Stock Market Analysis**  
Investment firms use functions to analyze stock trends:  

```python
def percentage_change(old, new):
    return ((new - old) / old) * 100

print(percentage_change(150, 180))  # Output: 20.0%
```

## **1.5 Components of a Function**  
### **📌 Key Parts of a Function**  
1. **Function Name** – The function’s identifier (e.g., `greet`).  
2. **Parameters** – Values the function receives (e.g., `name` in `greet(name)`).  
3. **Return Value** – The output the function produces.  
4. **Function Call** – Running the function with specific arguments.  

### **Example Function: Greeting a User**  
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```
✅ **Explanation:**  
- `greet("Alice")` calls the function with `"Alice"` as input.  
- The function returns **"Hello, Alice!"**  

---

## **1.6 Conclusion and Exercises**  
✅ Functions **help organize code, avoid repetition, and simplify problem-solving.**  
✅ They originated from **mathematics** and are now crucial in programming.  
✅ **Real-world examples** include weather prediction, finance, and online shopping.  

### **📝 Exercises**  
1. Write a function that **converts kilometers to miles**.  
2. Write a function to **calculate the perimeter of a rectangle**.  
3. Modify the `greet` function to include the **user's age** in the message.
